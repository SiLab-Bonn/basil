Basil is a modular data acquisition system and system testing framework in Python.

It also provides generic FPGA firmware modules for different hardware platforms and drivers for wide range of lab appliances.

Features
========
Firmware:
  - very simple single master bus definition
  - multiple basic modules (SPI, SEQ, GPIO, I2C, JTAG)
  - multiple interfaces (UART, USB2, USB3, Ethernet)
Software:
  - layer structure following hardware
  - generation based on yaml file
  - register abstract layer (RAL)
  - simulator interface allows software test against simulated RTL (thanks to `cocotb <https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb>`_)

Installation
============

Clone the repository to get a copy of the source code (for developers):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/basil.git
    cd basil
    pip install -e .

or install via PyPI into the Python's site-packages folder (for non-developers):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install basil_daq==version

where version is a version number (e.g., 3.0.1)

or install from git, when no PyPI package is available (for non-developers):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/basil.git@branch

where branch is a branch name or tag (e.g., master or v3.0.1).

Check `.travis.yml <.travis.yml>`_ for installation/testing hints.
